        <p>First of all, I am a <span title="A pharmacist is a person who has studied the pharmacy profession 
            and is resposible for drugs at large.">Pharmacist</span>. I studied at Madonna University but i have
        always had a passion for coding. I just feel its the future of <strong>Mankind</strong></p>

        <p>I am also into <span title="I presently know html, css, javascrip, markdown, git, github and can't
             wait to learn react and redux">tech and coding</span>. Started 2014 when i began to learn about <strong>HTML</strong>.
        From here, i just felt that i had more to do and learn.</p>

        <div class="poetry"><p>I love <span>poetry</span>. It was something I just found fascinating how I could express my ideas, 
            thoughts and emotions in writings. It brings out the deep part of me.</p>
        
            <!-- My Poetic Work           -->
        <div class="poet"><h4>Love or Hate</h4>
                <blockquote> I can both hate and love you at the same time. <br> Not because I 
                don't love you, neither because I hate you. you just always seem to do loving and 
                hateful things.<br> Your smile any good day would keep me at peace and your warm 
                hugs makes me feel your warmth everytime. Sometimes, I hate when you smile when its not 
                towards me as I also hate when you hold hands when mine isn't with yours.<br>
                My feelings are understandable, very understandable. Words I mutter like an anthem when you 
                give me any of my extreme feelings.<br> How now I wish you could have my heart in your hands.
                So you understand how it beats with you and without you.<br><br>
            <strong><i>La_poetter</i></strong></blockquote></div>
            <!-- Ends here                -->

        <p>Concerning my <span title="I have had my heart borken. Also, I have had my heart 
            repaired.">Relationship Life</span>, I have been in love twice! I guess, lol. First at 2
            017 then at 2022. But none seems to just work for me and i don't know why. Maybe I am a sucker!</p>
        
        <p>On my <span title="Omo! E choke. Hoping fo the best and striving towards it.">Future Goals</span>, 
            I would love to grow my knowledge in both my coding and profession. 
            I believe and can properly be productive in the two and i also hold strongle that, 
            they ought to work together. Code and Health brings about positive patient outcomes.
